## About This Article:
In this article, we will examine layer 2 networks in Uniswap. <br />
Uniswap is one of the most powerful and largest decentralized platforms in the cryptocurrency world, following its successful launch on the Ethereum network in previous years. <br />
After its significant success on the Ethereum network, Uniswap started to add layer 2 networks. <br />
With new versions and special technologies, it was able to achieve tremendous success on these networks as well. <br />
Now, after years of activity, we will examine the layer 2 networks of this crypto giant to gather interesting insights and statistics. <br />

## First Trade in Each L2 Chain:

The lifetime of layer 2 networks on Uniswap is determined based on the days until November 1, 2023. <br />
The calculation is based on the first trade on each network. <br />
Arbitrum, with 882 days, is considered the first layer 2 network on Uniwwap, while the Base network is the newest layer 2 network with only 92 days as a young network active on Uniswap. <br />

## Difference in Distribution of Trading Activity:

By examining the types of Uniswap users, we have identified an interesting classification. <br />
We consider trades less than $10,000 as retail users, trades between $10,000 and $100,000 as large retail users, and trades over $100,000 as whale users. <br />
The number of whale trades on Arbitrum network is extremely high, with over 28.4K trades observed above $100,000. This is despite the fact that the number of whale trades on the Celo network has been twice as many.  <br />
The number of retail trades on the Optimism network is higher than that of other layer 2 networks active on Uniswap, with a total of 51.5M trades. <br />
On the other hand, the Avalanche network has the lowest number of trades in this category, with only 363.8K trades. <br />
The average trade value on the Arbitrum network was around $2.3K, while the Celo network had the lowest average trade value at $99.4. <br />
