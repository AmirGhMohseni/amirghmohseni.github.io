## I. Introduction
In the ever-shifting realm of cryptographic currencies and the intricacies of decentralized finance (DeFi), Uniswap emerges as a formidable force orchestrating the ballet of trading, liquidity provision, and the intricate machinations that sustain the ecosystem's very essence. One is compelled to ponder: how does Uniswap gracefully pirouette through the ebullient expanse of bullish market fervor and somberly waltz amidst the bearish undertones? In this labyrinthine exposition, we embark on a cerebral odyssey, dissecting the idiosyncrasies of Uniswap's liquidity pools during epochs of exuberance and despondency, unearthing the Herculean challenges that stand as towering monoliths and the labyrinthine strategies that thread the needle through the capricious tapestry of market volatility.

## II. Uniswap Pools
### A. Unraveling Uniswap in the Bosom of Bullish Exuberance

In the kaleidoscopic tapestry of bullish epochs, where the cadence of rising prices orchestrates a symphony of optimistic market sentiment, Uniswap liquidity pools ascend as veritable pillars, staunchly buttressing the deluge of heightened trading fervor. A pulsating dance unfolds, as the market, bathed in the effulgence of positivity, witnesses Uniswap's decentralized sanctuaries becoming the nexus of voracious trading pursuits. The demand for liquidity, akin to a ravenous tide, surges forth, and the decentralized fabric of Uniswap unfurls, providing an effervescent conduit to an expansive spectrum of trading pairs. A heterogeneous cohort of liquidity providers, lured by the siren call of incentives, gravitates toward these pools, their assets woven into the intricate lattice, weaving an elaborate tapestry of financial fecundity. Fees, akin to nectar, flow into the coffers of these contributors, fostering an environment where liquidity luxuriantly abounds. In this veritable oasis, traders navigate the labyrinth of transactions with an alacrity nurtured by abundant liquidity, orchestrating trades with a virtuosic finesse that begets an overall euphoric trading odyssey.

### B. Unraveling Uniswap Amidst the Murky Embrace of Bearish Despondency

Contrarily, within the shadowy recesses of bearish epochs, where the symphony is replaced by the dissonant dirge of descending prices and a shroud of pessimism cloaks the market, Uniswap liquidity pools stand resolute, facing the crucible of unique tribulations. The undulating trajectory of prices, now in a protracted descent, engenders an atmosphere of trepidation, inducing traders and investors into a measured retreat, diminishing the once fervent cadence of trading activity. This attenuation in demand, akin to a dwindling current, manifests as a double-edged sword, as it casts its aspersions on the availability of liquidity within the Uniswap pools. The consequence—a labyrinth of spreads widens, and the specter of slippage lurks ominously.

Yet, in this chiaroscuro of financial uncertainty, the automated market-making machinery of Uniswap emerges as a luminescent beacon. Algorithmic acrobatics, perpetually recalibrating token valuations in response to the ebb and flow of supply and demand, serve as a guardian, ensuring assets persistently frolic within the realm of tradability. The permissionless ethos of Uniswap unfurls its wings, facilitating the continual infusion of novel trading pairs into the fold. A magnetic allure beckons liquidity providers, visionaries in search of opportunities amidst undervalued assets or tokens harboring latent potential, becoming architects of a liquidity resurgence in defiance of bearish shadows.

### C. Percentage distribution of blockchains in lps created in Uniswap
Behold the intricate tapestry unfurling below, a visual sonnet portraying the esoteric dance of Liquidity Providers (LPs) within the Uniswap ecosystem across the vast expanse of blockchains over temporal epochs.

The chart unfolds as an ever-evolving manuscript, meticulously updated weekly, intricately capturing the rhythmic dance of LP creations. Ethereum emerges as the central protagonist in this statistical ballet, witnessing a crescendo of LPs birthing into existence, their genesis interwoven with the fabric of time. The audacious Polygan network asserts its presence, claiming a substantial portion of the LP landscape, yet Ethereum stands as an indomitable sovereign, towering over its blockchain counterparts.

The diagram transforms into a cosmic ballet of percentages, each network—whether a recent entrant or an established denizen—staking its claim in the coveted LP realm. Ethereum, resilient and regal, maintains its apical zenith, orchestrating an unparalleled symphony of LP ascendancy. In the grand narrative of LP proliferation, each network inscribes its numerical legacy onto the Uniswap palimpsest. Ethereum, an enduring protagonist, not only retains but ascends to the pinnacle, a testament to its unwavering allure amidst the perpetual ebb and flow of blockchain dynamics.

### D. ETH price with number of LPs over time on Uniswap
Embark on a mystifying journey through Ethereum's price evolution from January 2021 to July 2022, witnessing the fluctuating dance of liquidity pool creation, ranging from 160 to a staggering 1894 per week. A symphony of bullish enthusiasm echoes, inviting investors into a diverse array of opportunities. However, July 2022 introduces a clandestine metamorphosis, a paradoxical surge in Uniswap LP creation amidst a market in retreat. The zenith occurs in the week of 05-15-2023, where LPs reach an unprecedented ATH of 5392, defying market pessimism. A cryptic subplot unfolds with Bitcoin's ascent mirroring Ethereum, orchestrating a subtle reduction in LPs, impacting the fabric of liquidity creation. December 2023's pages hold the continuation of this esoteric narrative, challenging norms and perplexing market seekers.

## III. Bitcoin buying/selling power in Uniswap and its dependence on Volume
In this review, we calculated the volume of sales and purchase volume of Bitcoin in Uniswap and calculated the power of buying and selling on a monthly basis with this method.
In the month when the number is negative, it means that the selling power of Bitcoin is more than buying, and in the month when the number is positive, it means that the buying power of Bitcoin is more than selling.
In the last few months, we have seen an increase in the purchasing power of Bitcoin on Uniswap. We have calculated the buying/selling power cumulatively (the line that can be seen in the graph) and we have seen an increase in the purchasing power of Bitcoin since the 6th month of 2023.
